# Component Library

This section provides a reference for the Mintlify components available for use in the Clipron AI documentation. These components help structure content, improve readability, and add interactive elements.

## Basic Components

</Note>

<Info>

</Info>

<Warning>
  This is a warning about potential risks.
</Warning>

<Tip>

</Tip>
```

### Code Blocks and Code Groups

For displaying code examples.

```mdx
```python

print("Hello, world!")
```

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.clipron.com/status"
```

```javascript JavaScript
fetch('/api/status');
```

```python Python
import requests
requests.get("https://api.clipron.com/status")
```
</CodeGroup>
```

### Images

Embedding images in your documentation.

```mdx
<img src="/images/screenshot.png" alt="Description of the screenshot" />
```

## Layout Components

### Card Group and Card

For creating visually grouped content or navigation links.

```mdx
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Card Title 1" icon="home" href="/link1">
    Description for card 1.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Card Title 2" icon="settings" href="/link2">
    Description for card 2.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
```

### Accordion Group and Accordion

```mdx
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Section 1 Title">
    Content for section 1.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Section 2 Title">
    Content for section 2.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

### Steps and Step

For outlining sequential steps in a process.

```mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="First Action">
    Perform the first action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Action">

  </Step>
</Steps>
```

### Tabs and Tab

```mdx
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Option A">
    Content for option A.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option B">
    Content for option B.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

## API Reference Components

Mintlify provides specific components for structuring API documentation, often used in conjunction with an `openapi.json` file. While the full power comes from the OpenAPI integration, you can structure manual API docs using standard Markdown and components like `CodeGroup` for request/response examples.

Refer to the `api-reference/openapi.json` and existing API `.mdx` files for examples of how API documentation is structured.

## Customization

While Mintlify components offer a standard look and feel, some aspects like colors are controlled by the `docs.json` configuration. Ensure your usage aligns with the overall theme defined in `docs.json`.
