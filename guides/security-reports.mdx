# Security Reports

Clipron AI generates comprehensive security reports for your codebases, highlighting potential vulnerabilities, security hotspots, and compliance issues. This guide helps you understand how to navigate and interpret these reports effectively.

## Report Structure

Each security report is typically organized into the following sections:

*   **Overview:** A summary of the analysis, including the number of vulnerabilities found, severity distribution, and overall security score.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** A detailed list of identified security flaws, categorized by type (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, insecure configurations).
*   **Security Hotspots:** Areas in your code that might not be direct vulnerabilities but require manual review due to potential security implications.
*   **Compliance:** Assessment against various security standards and regulations (e.g., OWASP Top 10, GDPR, HIPAA).
*   **Recommendations:** Actionable advice on how to remediate identified issues, often with code examples.

## Interpreting Findings

For each finding, the report provides:

*   **Severity:** Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational.
*   **Description:** A clear explanation of the vulnerability or hotspot.
*   **Location:** File path and line number where the issue was detected.
*   **CWE/CVE ID (if applicable):** Common Weakness Enumeration or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifiers.
*   **Remediation Steps:** Specific instructions to fix the issue.

## Filtering and Prioritizing

You can often filter reports by:

*   **Severity:** Focus on critical and high-severity issues first.
*   **Type:** Group similar vulnerabilities for batch remediation.
*   **File/Module:** Prioritize issues in critical parts of your application.

## Exporting Reports

Reports can typically be exported in various formats (e.g., PDF, JSON, CSV) for sharing or integration with other tools.

## Integrating with CI/CD
