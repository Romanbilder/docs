# Credits & Payments

Clipron AI uses a credit-based system for analysis consumption. This guide explains how credits work, pricing tiers, payment management, and optimization strategies.

## Credit System Overview

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="How Credits Work" icon="coins">
    Credits are consumed when running security analyses. Different analysis types use different amounts of credits based on complexity and AI model costs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Credit Pricing" icon="dollar-sign">
    Credits are purchased in packages or included with subscription plans. Unused credits carry over month-to-month with no expiration.
  </Card>
