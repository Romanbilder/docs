# Authentication Problems

This guide helps you troubleshoot common authentication and login issues you might encounter when using Clipron AI.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Incorrect Credentials

*   **Problem:** You receive an "Invalid username or password" error.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Double-check your username and password for typos.
    *   Ensure Caps Lock is not enabled.
    *   If you've forgotten your password, use the "Forgot Password" link on the login page to reset it.

### 2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues

*   **Problem:** You are unable to receive or enter your 2FA code.
*   **Solution:**
    *   **Check your authenticator app:** Ensure the time on your device is synchronized correctly.
    *   **Check your email/SMS:** If using email or SMS for 2FA, check your spam folder or ensure your phone has signal.
    *   **Recovery Codes:** Use one of your recovery codes if you have them.
    *   **Contact Support:** If all else fails, contact Clipron AI support for assistance in resetting your 2FA.

### 3. Account Locked

*   **Problem:** Your account has been locked due to too many failed login attempts.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Wait for the lockout period to expire (usually a few minutes).
    *   Attempt to reset your password.
    *   Contact support if you need immediate access.

### 4. Browser/Cookie Issues

*   **Problem:** You are logged out frequently or cannot log in despite correct credentials.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Clear your browser's cache and cookies.
    *   Try logging in using an incognito/private browsing window.
    *   Disable any browser extensions that might interfere with authentication.
    *   Try a different browser.

### 5. API Key Issues

*   **Problem:** Your API requests are failing with authentication errors.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Ensure your API key is correct and has not expired.
    *   Verify that the API key has the necessary permissions for the actions you are trying to perform.
    *   Regenerate the API key if you suspect it has been compromised or is invalid.
